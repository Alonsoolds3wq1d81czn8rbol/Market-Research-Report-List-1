<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viral Gene Therapy</li><li>Non-Viral Gene Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy is a growing field with various approaches to treat genetic disorders. Viral gene therapy utilizes modified viruses to deliver healthy genes into the patient's cells, replacing faulty genes. This method has shown promising results but can cause immune responses. Non-viral gene therapy, on the other hand, uses different delivery mechanisms like liposomes or nanoparticles to introduce the therapeutic genes. Although non-viral methods are safer, they are less efficient in gene transfer. Both types aim to correct genetic defects and offer potential solutions for inherited diseases.</p></p>
