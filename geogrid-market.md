<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uniaxial</li><li>Biaxial</li><li>Triaxial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geogrids are used in construction and civil engineering projects to reinforce soil and provide stability. There are three main types of geogrids: uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial. </p><p>Uniaxial geogrids have strength in one direction, providing reinforcement for retaining walls and slopes. Biaxial geogrids have strength in two directions, making them ideal for stabilizing pavement and foundations. Triaxial geogrids have strength in three directions, offering maximum reinforcement for heavy duty applications such as railroad beds and embankments. Each type of geogrid caters to specific engineering needs.</p></p>
