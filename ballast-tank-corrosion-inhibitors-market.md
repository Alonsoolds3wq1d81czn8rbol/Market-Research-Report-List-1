<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ballast Tank Corrosion Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ferrous Ballast Tank Corrosion Inhibitors</li><li>Non Ferrous Ballast Tank Corrosion Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ballast tank corrosion inhibitors are additives used to protect the metal surfaces of ballast tanks from corrosion. There are two main types of ballast tank corrosion inhibitors: Ferrous and Non-ferrous. Ferrous inhibitors are specifically designed for protecting iron and steel surfaces, while non-ferrous inhibitors are used for protecting non-ferrous metals like aluminum and copper. Both types of inhibitors work by forming a protective barrier on the metal surface, preventing corrosive elements from causing damage.</p></p>
