<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Lenses for Lithography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lenses for DUV</li><li>Lenses for EUV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical lenses for lithography can be categorized into two main types: lenses for Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography and lenses for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. DUV lenses are designed to operate at shorter wavelengths compared to EUV lenses, enabling higher resolution and finer features in the lithography process. On the other hand, EUV lenses are used for cutting-edge lithography techniques that require even shorter wavelengths for extreme precision and accuracy in semiconductor manufacturing. Both types play crucial roles in advancing the capabilities of lithography technology.</p></p>
