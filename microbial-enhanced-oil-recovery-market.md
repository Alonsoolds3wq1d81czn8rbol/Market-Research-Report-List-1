<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground Method</li><li>Reservoir Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) is a technique used in the oil industry to extract more oil from reservoirs. The Ground Method involves injecting microbes into the ground, where they help break down the oil and improve its flow characteristics. This method is typically used in shallow reservoirs. The Reservoir Method, on the other hand, involves injecting microbes directly into the oil reservoir. This method is often used in deep and low-permeable reservoirs. Both methods aim to increase oil recovery by stimulating microbial activity to enhance oil production.</p></p>
