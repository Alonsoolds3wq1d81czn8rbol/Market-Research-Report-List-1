<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Depth Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sensing</li><li>Passive Sensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Depth sensors can be categorized into two main types: active sensing and passive sensing. Active sensing involves emitting signals, such as infrared light, and measuring the time it takes for the signal to bounce back from an object to calculate depth. Passive sensing, on the other hand, relies on capturing ambient light or other environmental signals to determine depth. Each type of sensor has its own advantages and limitations, making them suitable for different applications in industries such as robotics, automotive, and consumer electronics.</p></p>
