<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Drainage Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Valved Implants</li><li>Nonvalved Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glaucoma drainage devices are used to treat patients with glaucoma by providing an alternative channel for aqueous humor to drain and decrease intraocular pressure. Valved implants have a one-way valve mechanism to regulate the flow of fluid, while nonvalved implants do not have a valve and rely on the natural tissue to regulate drainage. Valved implants are preferred for patients at high risk for hypotony, while nonvalved implants are suitable for patients with previous failed trabeculectomy or tube shunt surgeries.</p></p>
