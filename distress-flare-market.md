<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distress Flare Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Localisation System Type</li><li>Without Localisation System Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distress flares can be categorized into two market types based on their localization system. Flares with a localization system type are equipped with GPS or radio frequency technology to pinpoint the user's exact location when activated. On the other hand, flares without a localization system type do not have this technology and rely on their universal visibility to alert nearby vessels or aircraft of distress. Both types serve the same purpose of signaling for help in emergency situations.</p></p>
