<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-Type Transformer</li><li>Oil-Immersed Transformer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Power transformers are classified into two main types: Dry-type transformers and Oil-immersed transformers. Dry-type transformers are insulated with non-liquid materials and are commonly used in indoor applications due to their safety and low maintenance requirements. On the other hand, Oil-immersed transformers are filled with insulating oil, providing better cooling and insulation properties, making them suitable for outdoor use and high-power applications. Both types play a crucial role in transmitting and distributing electrical power efficiently and safely.</p></p>
