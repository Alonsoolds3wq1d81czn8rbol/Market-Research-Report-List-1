<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ammonia-Fuelled Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spark-Ignition Engine</li><li>Compression-Ignition Engine</li><li>Gas-Turbine Engine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ammonia-fueled engines come in three main types: spark-ignition engines, compression-ignition engines, and gas-turbine engines. Spark-ignition engines use a spark plug to ignite a mixture of ammonia and air, similar to gasoline engines. Compression-ignition engines compress the ammonia-air mixture until it reaches a high enough temperature for ignition to occur without a spark plug. Gas-turbine engines work by burning the ammonia directly in a combustion chamber, creating hot gases that drive a turbine to generate power.</p></p>
