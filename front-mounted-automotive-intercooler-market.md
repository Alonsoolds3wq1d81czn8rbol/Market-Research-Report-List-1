<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Front Mounted Automotive Intercooler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air to Air Intercooler</li><li>Water to Air Intercooler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Front-mounted automotive intercoolers are commonly classified into two main types: air to air intercoolers and water to air intercoolers. Air to air intercoolers use the ambient air passing through them to cool down the compressed air from the turbocharger. On the other hand, water to air intercoolers use a water-based system to transfer heat away from the compressed air. Both types of intercoolers are used to improve the efficiency and performance of turbocharged engines by reducing the intake air temperature.</p></p>
