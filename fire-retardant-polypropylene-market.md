<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Retardant Polypropylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Free Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire retardant polypropylene is available in two main types: halogen type and halogen-free type. Halogen type fire retardants contain halogen elements such as chlorine or bromine, which are effective in suppressing flames but can release toxic gases when burned. On the other hand, halogen-free type fire retardants do not contain halogen elements and are considered a more environmentally friendly alternative. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, with halogen-free types gaining popularity due to their safer environmental profile.</p></p>
