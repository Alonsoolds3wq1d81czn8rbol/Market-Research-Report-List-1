<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Powertrain Cooling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ATOC</li><li>ATF</li><li>ITOC</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Powertrain Cooling Systems are divided into four main types: Air to Oil Cooling (ATOC), Air to Fluid Cooling (ATF), Fluid to Oil Cooling (ITOC), and Others. ATOC systems cool the powertrain by transferring heat from oil to air. ATF systems use air or an external fluid to cool the powertrain. ITOC systems transfer heat from the powertrain to the cooling fluid directly. The "Others" category includes alternative cooling methods that do not fall into the aforementioned types.</p></p>
