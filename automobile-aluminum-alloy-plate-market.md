<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Aluminum Alloy Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Rolling</li><li>Hot Rolling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automobile aluminum alloy plates can be classified into two main types based on the manufacturing process: cold rolling and hot rolling. Cold rolling involves the metal being passed through rollers at room temperature, resulting in a smooth surface finish and improved strength. Hot rolling, on the other hand, involves heating the metal and then passing it through rollers, which results in a less uniform surface but higher ductility. Both types of plates are commonly used in the automotive industry for their lightweight and high-strength properties.</p></p>
